**Overview of the project** -

**PROJECT :-** **STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM** (C++)
![task-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ff84b46-c7b7-4685-a3dc-5e34ee2e68f4)

**OBJECTIVE :-**

> Provide an easy-to-use interface for managing student records without relying on external tools or software.
> Utilize object-oriented programming principles, including classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, to create a modular 
  and maintainable application.
> Serve as a learning tool for C++ developers to understand file handling, error handling, and user interaction on real-world 
  applications. 
> Ensure data is stored securely using file handling techniques, allowing for retrieval and update cross multiple sessions.
> Offer an interactive and straightforward console-based application to perform operations like adding, editing, and deleting student 
  information.

**KEY ACTIVITIES :-**

> Users can input new student details such as name, roll number, course, and grades into the system.
> The system allows viewing all student records in a structured and organized format.
> Users can search for specific student details by entering their roll number or name.
> Modify the details of an existing student, including grades, courses, oter information.
> Remove a student deatils  permanently from the system.
> Data can be saved to a file for persistence and reloaded when the program restarts.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED :-**

> Programming language : C++
> File Handling : Used for persistent data storage
> Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) concepts such as classes and objects
